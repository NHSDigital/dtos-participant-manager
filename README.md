Manage your screening allows users to see what screening they are eligible for and when their next appointment is due.

The project consists of a number of Azure functions and a user-interface built in Next.js which uses NHS login for user authentication.

## Setup

Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-participant-manager
cd dtos-participant-manager
```

### Prerequisites

The following software packages, or their equivalents, are expected to be installed and configured:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container runtime or a compatible tool, e.g. [Podman](https://podman.io/),
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - LTS
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) - .NET 9.0
- [Entity Framework Core tools reference - .NET Core CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet)
- [sqlcmd utility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=go%2Cwindows&pivots=cs1-bash)
- [Azure functions core tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=macos%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-csharp)
- [Azure Data Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?tabs=win-install%2Cwin-user-install%2Credhat-install%2Cwindows-uninstall%2Credhat-uninstall)
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 3.82 or later,

> [!NOTE]<br>
> The version of GNU make available by default on macOS is earlier than 3.82. You will need to upgrade it or certain `make` tasks will fail. On macOS, you will need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, then to install `make`, like so:
>
> ```shell
> brew install make
> ```
>
> You will then see instructions to fix your [`$PATH`](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_path.tmpl) variable to make the newly installed version available. If you are using [dotfiles](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles), this is all done for you.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) required to run Git hooks,
- [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

## Configuration

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and populate the missing environment variables which are listed at the top of the file.

## Usage

You can run the Azure functions, database and frontend with `make all`

Once you have the database running in Docker with `make db-migrations` you can then run the application with `make application`.

`make stop` will shut down all the processes.

### Testing

The full test suite can be ran with `make test`.

Unit tests can be ran with `make test-unit` and linting can be ran with `make test-lint`
