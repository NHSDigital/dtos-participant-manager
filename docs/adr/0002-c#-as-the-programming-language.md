# 2. C# as the programming language for the backend

Date: 2025-03-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The team needed to pick a programming language for the participant manager solution. The current team are all c# developers and some of the existing functionality that exists within Cohort Manager that needs bring into Participant Manager is already written in c#.

## Decision

Decision was to use C#

## Consequences

C# is still in the maintain status of the Tech Radar, but the desired language of choice is Python. So there is a potentially a long term piece of technical debt
