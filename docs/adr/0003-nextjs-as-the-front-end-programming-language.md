# 3. Nextjs as the front end programming language

Date: 2025-03-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There is a web front end component to this solution and there needs to be a choice of programming language. We have front end developers comfortable in multiple front end frameworks, but one overarching concern is the dependency on client side javascript. Ideally this can be server side rendered so as to provide a more inclusive service.

## Decision

The decision is to use NextJS server side rendered.

## Consequences

This aligns with the current tech radar strategy as well as supports Server Side Rendering
